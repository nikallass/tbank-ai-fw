"""The transfer money path — the one place where a bug costs the user cash.

Five defects, all from the audit and all verified against the real signed /v1/pay
in the capture (captures.xml #1477, p2p-anybank via SBP, HTTP 200):

1. The payer account was hardcoded to "first Current RUB with a positive balance"
   and could not be chosen. The skill tells the agent to ask the user which account
   to debit; the answer was then ignored.
2. No userPaymentId. The app sends one on every payment; without it a retry after a
   timeout is a second, unlinked transfer.
3. The bank's response was thrown away and the tool echoed its own arguments back
   ("Sent: 1000₽ to …"), losing paymentId — which is the only handle for a receipt
   and appears nowhere else afterwards.
4. `description` was accepted, documented, and never sent. The app puts it in
   providerFields.message.
5. The body diverged from the app's: no device/anti-fraud block, no deviceId, a wuid
   the app does not send there, and a paymentType that belongs to
   payment_commission, not to pay.

"""The docs and the code must not drift apart — this is the check that catches it.

Every previous audit found the same shape of bug: a tool is renamed or deleted, and
the documents that teach an agent how to call it keep the old name. It is invisible
because nothing executes a document. `grocery_pick_lightest` survived in docs/FLOWS.md
for a whole release after it was removed from server.py; an agent following that
line calls a tool that does not exist and has no way to recover.

The same rot hit the `flows` tool itself: it returned docs/FLOWS.md[:6000] while the file
had grown to ~12 000 chars, so every flow from the messenger down — cards, orders,
nutrition, tickets — was silently unreachable through the one tool meant to serve it.
Truncation is invisible from the inside, so it is pinned here by section, not by
character count.

"""How many HTTP round-trips a scenario costs.

Latency an agent sees is round-trips, and several tools were paying for requests
they did not need:

  * cards() issued one /v1/account_cards per account — 12 extra calls on this user,
    most of them 400s for deposits and invest accounts — although accounts_light
    already embeds the cards. The per-account response is also THINNER: it lacks the
    name, status, paymentSystem, masked number and expiry that list_cards prints.
  * grocery_add_to_cart downloaded the entire retailers catalogue on every call to
    read one areaId, which is a property of the store and never changes.
  * documents() asked for the prefill contact id twice in a single invocation.
  * grocery_rank fetched nutrition for up to 8 candidates strictly in sequence.
  * cinema_search walked today's listing one page at a time. Making that cheap by
    stopping at the first page holding a match traded requests for correctness —
    matches on later pages disappeared and the count was reported as complete — so
    the pages are now fetched concurrently instead: same answer, one round trip.

Each test counts the calls the real code makes against a session that records them.

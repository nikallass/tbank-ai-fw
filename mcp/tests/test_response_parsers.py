"""The server-side parsers that turn a bank payload into what the agent reads.

Two past fixes lived here and neither was pinned:

  45d50fb  grocery_order_status reported EVERY order as unpaid with an unknown sum.
           It read order.paymentInfo.paid and a top-level order.sum; neither exists.
           The real schema is order.{id,status,paymentId,cart{sum,goodsSum}} — and
           CREATED_DYNAMIC is the normal status of a placed order, not a failure.
  8a9f90f  messenger listings cut the conversationId to 24 chars with an ellipsis,
           so the id could not be passed to messenger_messages; bot chats showed as
           "?" because their name lives on the member, not on a title.

A parser that misreads a field does not crash — it produces a confident wrong
answer, which is why these need tests rather than eyeballing.

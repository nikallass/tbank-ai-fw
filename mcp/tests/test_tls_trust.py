"""Trust must come from pinned roots, never from whoever answers the connection.

src/tls.py used to "self-heal" a TLS failure by running `openssl s_client` against
the failing host — with no verification — and appending whatever certificates came
back into the file used as `verify=`. The only gate was a substring match on the
leaf's Subject DN, a field the peer chooses. A machine-in-the-middle presenting a
self-signed certificate naming the bank got installed as a trust anchor and the
retry then succeeded.

These tests execute the trust decisions rather than inspecting the source:
a real TLS server with a hostile self-signed certificate is stood up and the client
is pointed at it; a shipped root is tampered with byte-for-byte and reloaded.

"""What actually goes on the wire.

Every other test stubs `_call_read`, so the layer that builds the request — the one
that has caused the most production bugs in this repo — was pinned by nothing:

  b67cf9a  X-App-* headers injected on every host broke the lifestyle grocery cart
  33da29e  isSuspicious baked into the operations template made list_operations
           return nothing (283 operations without it, 0 with it)
  a8c6519  the full mobile client context was missing, causing a class of 400s
  cc54a62  payment_commission posted JSON to a form-urlencoded endpoint → 400
  8a9f90f  prefill/profile spells the session key `sessionId`, not `sessionid`
  18f60fe  id.t-bank-app.ru OIDC needs client_id and rejects the mobile-BFF params

These drive the real transport against a fake HTTP session and assert on the URL,
query and headers it produced.

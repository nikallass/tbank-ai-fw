"""Grocery checkout via Playwright (headless browser) — Phase 3 safety rewrite.

The T-Bank grocery checkout runs in a webview (www.tbank.ru) with JS that sets up
CSRF tokens, delivery slots, and the web session before calling order/create. A
headless browser runs that JS, then we call order/create + payment_gate_pay from
the page context.

CRITICAL: web cart sync requires these cookies (normally set by JS, set manually):
  - portalSID = mobile sessionid (links mobile cart → web cart)
  - sessionID = access_token
  - deviceId / stDeIdU / __P__wuid = device_id (lowercase)

Flow:
  1. cart/set via API (lifestyle.t-bank-app.ru) — already done
  2. Launch Playwright → set web cookies → load checkout page
  3. GET web cart → pre-delivery sum + goods
  4. POST deliveries (appId + pointId) → CHECK status → init delivery slots
  5. GET web cart AGAIN → post-delivery sum (weight items may recompute) — USE THIS
  6. POST order/create with the post-delivery sum (omit empty clientEmail)
  7. POST payment_gate_pay IMMEDIATELY (before auto-cancel) with the chosen account

Phase 3 changes vs the old fire-and-forget flow (#7/#8/#9/#10):
  - app_id is injected into the JS (no hardcoded 578); pointId is passed to deliveries.
  - deliveries HTTP status + error envelope are checked; a delivery failure stops the flow.
  - the cart is re-read AFTER deliveries and the POST-DELIVERY sum is used for order/create.
  - an empty clientEmail is omitted (not sent as "").
  - the payment ``agreement`` is a real selected account (was an undefined NameError).
  - every step is recorded in the attempt journal; an order created but not confirmed
    paid raises CheckoutUnknown so the server blocks an automatic (duplicate) retry.

NOTE (contract): the exact order/create body and the payment ``agreement`` identifier
are taken from the prior implementation's shape + these safety fixes — they are NOT
re-verified against a fresh authorized frontend trace. Validate with a small live order.

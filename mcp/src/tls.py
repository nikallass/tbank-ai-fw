"""CA trust for the T-Bank MCP.

The bank's hosts split in two, by suffix rather than by count:
  * `*.t-bank-app.ru` chains to the **Russian Trusted Root CA** (Минцифры), which no
    Linux/macOS trust store ships. Every one of them fails without it.
  * `*.tbank.ru`, `*.tinkoff.ru`, `api.tinsurance.ru` chain to publicly-trusted roots
    already in the system store (they were HARICA, they are TrustAsia now — the CA
    changed under us and nothing needed to be done, which is the point).

So the bundle is: **system CAs + the pinned Russian root**, and nothing else, which
passes every host in `BANK_HOSTS`. That list is derived from the endpoint table
rather than typed out — see bank_hosts() for what the typed-out version cost.

WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN (audit, 2026-07-25). It used to "self-heal": on any TLS
failure it ran `openssl s_client` against the failing host — with no verification —
and appended whatever certificates came back into the file used as `verify=`. The
only gate was a substring match on the leaf's Subject DN, a field supplied by
whoever answered the connection. So any machine-in-the-middle presenting a
self-signed certificate with `*.t-bank-app.ru` in its subject got itself installed
as a trust anchor, and the retry then succeeded. TLS verification was not weakened,
it was *inverted*: the attacker chose the trust store. That is gone. Trust now comes
only from the system store and from root certificates committed to this repo and
pinned by SHA-256 — never from the network.

ROTATION, WITHOUT BREAKING ANYTHING. Pinning a *root* is what makes leaf and
intermediate rotation a non-event: the bank can (and does) reissue those whenever it
likes and verification keeps working, because the anchor never moved. The old code
re-fetched leaves on every failure precisely because it trusted no root — it was
solving a problem it had created. Roots are long-lived (this one runs to 2032). If a
root ever IS replaced, drop the new PEM into `ca/roots/` or point `TBANK_EXTRA_CA`
at it and it is picked up on the next start, no code change and no release needed;
the error you get until then names the file to add rather than failing obscurely.
